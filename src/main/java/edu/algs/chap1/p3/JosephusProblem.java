/**
 * 1.3.37  Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits and agree
 * to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle
 * (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person until
 * only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated.
 * Write a Queue client Josephus that takes M and N from the command line and prints out the order in which
 * people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
